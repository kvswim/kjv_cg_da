Pset2 Exercise 1

a) y|x~N(B+sum(BjXj, sigma^2)
argmin-sum((log(1/sqrt(2pi)r^2)*exp((-1/2sigma^2)*(y-B-sum(XjBj))^2)
argmin - sum(logc-1/2pi^2(y-(B-sum(XjBj))^2)
argmin sum(y-(B+sum(XjBj))^2)

b) The ridge regression loss function serves to calculate the penalty incurred by 
estimating with a linear regression function such a sshown above.
