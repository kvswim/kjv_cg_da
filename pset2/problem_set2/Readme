Problem Set 2

Please go easy on me...I'm finishing this at 30,000 feet and it's so
turbulent that I might vomit. You know that feeling you get when you go off a rollercoaster
and your stomach gets that unpleasant weightless feeling? Yeah...try that 
off and on for 4 hours. People around me are holding their seats for dear life 
while I mindlessly attempt to taka-taka-taka-fail my way through this assignment.

I've struggled with this pset HARD for
the past week or so and now I'm 3 late days in and it's STILL not finished.

All solutions are written into the python files unless explicitly indicated otherwise.
All i want is some partial credit...
